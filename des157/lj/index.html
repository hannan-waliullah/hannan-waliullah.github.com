            My project is about the cookies I have baked in the past and the stories behind them, 
            reminiscent of a food blog, but interactive. This photo below below shows one of my cookies: 
            the snickerdoodle. It is one of the four cookies that I have chosen to showcase for my project.
             While the photo is not anything spectacular, it highlights the character and patterns of the 
             cinnamon-infused cookie. It also has a story behind it, why I make it, and the memories associated 
             with it.  These cookies were my sisters favorite, and we’d make them together. When my sister moved to 
             college I would mail them from my town to her college in order to stay connected with her.

            Amanda’s project is about her parents and their history. The photos have such a rich character. 
            They feel like older polaroids, and imply stories. All three photos include two people: her parents,
             and two of the photos also include other people. These are  truly an example of how a picture can be
              a thousand words. While the images are of Amanda's family smiling in the photo (like how family 
              photos are usually taken), there seems more to each image than meets the eye. It leaves me wondering 
              : what is the story behind each image? Why were they taken? How has this shaped Amanda to who she is today?

            The pudding is a news-website which focuses on multimedia journalism.
             Their publication explores different forms of image manipulation, data visualization,
              and other interactive techniques for journalistic storytelling. The story “Best Year 
              in Music”, takes the reader through a journey of all the number 1 singles from the 
              1960’s to modern day.

            In this story, the albums-art images are put onto a moving 3-d graph, with the albums
             “approaching” the screen as time moves forward. Additionally, the user is able to 
             fast-forwards (or move back), in order to select any desired year. Finally, the number 
             one song (at the charts current date) is playing in the background, in order to create 
             a more immersive experience. The page is also able to be paused or muted, making it 
             more accessible.

        <p class="journaltext"> 
            This page was interesting for me because it used images and interactivity in multiple 
            effective instances. For one, despite the user not being able to click or hover over 
            the image explicitly, the image still had the sense of interactivity through the 
            pause/play button. Another reason is that it gave users freedom to choose a year. 
            Finally, the music being played really highlighted the immersiveness of an audio-visual 
            experience.

        <h2 class="headline"> Response 2: Modal Design</h2>
        <p class="date"> 28 Jan 2021 <p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Modals (also known as overlays), can be a very powerful means of interaction when used properly. 
            In her article “Best practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog windows”, author Naema Baskanderi explains 
            different practices in order to provide the best user experience when using overlays. Modals are elements 
            that sit on top of the applications main window, forcing interaction with the user.
            
        </p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Baskanderi provides different strategies for creating an ideal modal experience. 
            For example, designers should provide an easy way to exit the modal window. 
            In many advertisements today, the “close” button appears a few seconds after the rest of the modal
             (which in my opinion is not good UX). Additionally, modals should be properly titles, and 
             buttons clearly labelled. We should consider different visual elements when designing a modal-- 
             such as their location & size, and using a lightbox effect surrounding the modal. Finally, we can make 
             modals more accessible through the use of keyboard shortcuts. 
        </p>  
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            When used properly, modals can provide a simpler UI and a more attentive user experience. 
            However, when used improperly, modals can be akin to a pop-up window: the user will probably 
            ignore it.

        <h2 class="headline"> Response 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="date"> 21 Jan 2021 <p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            When designing a form, designers should strive to make it easy and approachable
            for the user. In the article “Best Practices for Form Design”, author Salim Ansari
             lists 20 different considerations when creating an interactive form. It’s important 
             to keep in mind all of the different aspects of the form, from the writing of the 
             input fields to the visual hierarchy of the form. When writing a form, we should 
             eliminate unnecessary questions and gradually increase  the complexity of questions. 
             We should avoid using negative language and blaming the user.
            
        </p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Additionally, we have to consider the user interface of the form. This includes placement 
            of the text, alignment, size, color, etc. The author points out smaller things we can design
             for in order to enhance the user experience. For example, highlighting the first input box 
             can make it easier for the user to locate it. It’s important for the form to be accessible 
             to all users. Accessibility of the form includes proper contrast, text size, and other 
             considerations.
