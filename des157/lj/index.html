        <h2 class="headline"> Response 2: Modal Design</h2>
        <p class="date"> 28 Jan 2021 <p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Modals (also known as overlays), can be a very powerful means of interaction when used properly. 
            In her article “Best practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog windows”, author Naema Baskanderi explains 
            different practices in order to provide the best user experience when using overlays. Modals are elements 
            that sit on top of the applications main window, forcing interaction with the user.
            
        </p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Baskanderi provides different strategies for creating an ideal modal experience. 
            For example, designers should provide an easy way to exit the modal window. 
            In many advertisements today, the “close” button appears a few seconds after the rest of the modal
             (which in my opinion is not good UX). Additionally, modals should be properly titles, and 
             buttons clearly labelled. We should consider different visual elements when designing a modal-- 
             such as their location & size, and using a lightbox effect surrounding the modal. Finally, we can make 
             modals more accessible through the use of keyboard shortcuts. 
        </p>  
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            When used properly, modals can provide a simpler UI and a more attentive user experience. 
            However, when used improperly, modals can be akin to a pop-up window: the user will probably 
            ignore it.

        <h2 class="headline"> Response 1: Form Design</h2>
        <p class="date"> 21 Jan 2021 <p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            When designing a form, designers should strive to make it easy and approachable
            for the user. In the article “Best Practices for Form Design”, author Salim Ansari
             lists 20 different considerations when creating an interactive form. It’s important 
             to keep in mind all of the different aspects of the form, from the writing of the 
             input fields to the visual hierarchy of the form. When writing a form, we should 
             eliminate unnecessary questions and gradually increase  the complexity of questions. 
             We should avoid using negative language and blaming the user.
            
        </p>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Additionally, we have to consider the user interface of the form. This includes placement 
            of the text, alignment, size, color, etc. The author points out smaller things we can design
             for in order to enhance the user experience. For example, highlighting the first input box 
             can make it easier for the user to locate it. It’s important for the form to be accessible 
             to all users. Accessibility of the form includes proper contrast, text size, and other 
             considerations.
