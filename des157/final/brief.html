        <h2 class="headline"> Project Summary</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            The re-imagined “Deep Sea Adventure” will incorporate interactive scrolling
            in order to elevate the project by showcasing the depth of the ocean.        
        </p>
       
        <h2 class="headline"> Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            BBC’s “Space Race: How Big is space?” creates a scrolling journey through space. 
            You start from earth, and as you scroll down, you leave earth and venture into the solar system. 
            The interface design is really clean, it gives you the total distance, the scale of the journey, 
            and the “length” of the journey at the speed of light. As you scroll down, it provides you with facts 
            at the current depth -- height of the highest skydiver, where the atmosphere ends, and more.  What’s 
            working well is that they really create depth, however it is tedious to scroll all the way down, so 
            they should have provided a mechanism to skip along the journey. Additionally, the illustration style
             & design is super clean and takes advantage of the vast empty space.

        <h2 class="headline"> Comparison Project 2</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            Neal’s Universe forecast uses vertical scrolling to represent time (rather than space). As you scroll down,
            you see what will happen in the future. It also takes you on a journey through time -- from today to 
            10^30 years from now. It uses animations to help create a more immersive experience, and also tells
            a story through facts, ending on a positive note. What works well is how intentional the visual 
            elements are -- from the stars to the animation, to all the elements of space. However, the page
            could have incorporated more interactive elements rather than just having the continuous scroll.

        <h2 class="headline"> Project Goals</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            The goal of this project is to use vertical scrolling in order to elevate the “deep sea adventure” studio to a
            different level. By using horizontal scrolling elements, I wanted to take advantage of the “infinite” that a
            web page can have in order to create a truly interactive experience. Like the first project, I want to have
            a sense of scale and depth and represent that through visuals. Like the second project, I want to also create
            a sense of journey through the page. At this point, I’m unsure if I want to keep the “mad-libs” aspect of 
            the original studio project, but I definitely want to keep the aspect of adventure.
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline"> Design Strategies</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            As stated previously, I want to use negative space and proximity to really capture the depth of the ocean. 
            Additionally, I want to keep the design minimalistic: have simple-yet-effective hand drawn elements. Additionally,
            for the illustration style, I want to keep a similar illustration style from the original studio, with a
            bright color scheme that creates a lighter, fun adventure.  As you go deeper into the ocean, the absence of 
            light disappears, so I also want to incorporate a changing visual component: as you go deeper, the color palette 
            becomes more contrasted and less saturated. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline"> Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            The main interaction will be the downward scroll. The depth of the window will be measured through the strategies
             we’ve learned in javascript. However, because the window might be longer than expected, I might also incorporate 
             a smooth scroll effect in order to make the journey less tedious. Additionally, I want to incorporate interactive 
             animations while you’re scrolling, with how the text pops up, maybe bubbles or particles floating around in the 
             background. Finally, I wanted to incorporate an interaction where the color palette darkens as you scroll down the 
             page. With these interactive elements, I hope to create an interactive adventure experience.
     
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline"> Experience Goals</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            For many humans, it’s truly hard to imagine a large scale. We tend to measure scale in comparisons (how many times have
            newspapers measured large areas in terms of football fields or olympic-sized swimming pools? A lot). Through this project
            I want to exploit humanity's inability to explain large sizes. With the re-imagined deep-sea adventure, I want to take users
            on an experience through the deep sea and let them immerse themselves in the sea. Additionally, I want to practice UX
            strategies and how they can affect storytelling in the deepest sense. Overall, my goal through this project is to tell a story. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline"> Audience</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            The audience of this project is both the teaching team and other students in DES 157: Interactive Media II. I want to 
            incorporate the strategies learned throughout the course in order to create an interactive journey. Additionally, 
            the secondary audience for this project is adventurers, lovers of the sea and those curious about the spaces not 
            inhabited by humanity.
        </p>
