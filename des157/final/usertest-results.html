        <h2 class="headline"> Observation 1: User-centered Text </h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            One observation I noticed is that all of my users tended to skim over the text blocks rather than read them. 
            Since my project is quite text heavy, I need to account for this. I think going forward, the main subtitle 
            for each section should be more direct rather than story oriented. For example, instead of  the subtitle being : 
            “What’s that?”I should change it to “You see a giant squid!”, or something direct like that. That way, users 
            can still get the experience without fully committing to read. Better writing (and better placement of writing)
             is better UX, and I should edit my page to have a more succinct type hierarchy.       
        </p>
       
        <h2 class="headline"> Observation 2: Placement of interactions</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            I had put a “fast forward” button on my page, however my users didn’t notice it right away.
             I think because it was tucked away in the bottom left hand corner, many people didn’t notice it. 
             I should make it more visible, especially since people don’t want to scroll massive depth. Proper 
             placement of buttons and interactable objects should be noticeable at first glance, yet also not too 
             distracting. My users gave different strategies to fix this design problem: maybe move the location of
              the button, or make it larger and more prominent. Overall, I noticed that the users used the buttons,
            so I should put them in a more usable place.

        <h2 class="headline">Observation 3: Testing different browswers</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            The last observation I noticed is that the placement of objects / fonts may not be 100% what my browser sees. 
            I noticed that even if the requirements said to design it for a certain width, not all viewers will view it at
             that width. Many users like to keep a minimized window, and my design kind of broke down when not at the “optimal”
              dimensions. As a result, I think I need to plan for some responsiveness. (Or at least, stop mixing responsive 
              elements with absolute elements.  Additionally, make sure that all the font sheets are linked correctly so 
              the font shows up.
        </p>

        <h2 class="headline">Next Steps</h2>
        <p class="journaltext"> 
            First, I need to finish some of the broken elements on my page that I noticed weren’t working correctly when user’s 
            were testing. Then, I want to make some of the more observational changes: I’m going to edit the story to make it 
            more user-friendly. I’m going to rearrange some (not all) of the UI in order to make it more visible to new users. 
            Finally, I’m going to do some more testing on different browsers to make sure everything is working properly, Overall,
             today’s user feedback session was super insightful and gave me lots of things to think about.
