                Food is memory. The senses - taste, smell, texture, and sight - 
                can work together in unison to transport one back to a different time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always loved to bake (I haven’t always been good at it, though). 
                I’ve tried countless cookie variations in the past. Here are some of my favorites.

            <h1>snicker-<br>doodle</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookie. 
                They’re also my sister’s favorite too. Whenever 
                she visited home from college, we would make these. 
                She’d take the extra dough back to her college town.

 
            </p>
            <p>
                Years later, I ended up in the same college: UC Davis. 
                Although both my sisters are married and with their own 
                family now, these cookies remind me that we are connected 
                in more ways than one.

            <hr>
            <p>
                I’ve baked countless chocolate chip cookies, using many, many different recipes.
                 Despite this being a classic, everyone has their own take on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always had a hard time making new friends. But everyone loves a good chocolate
                 chip cookie. I made these once a week in my first college apartment. Maybe thats 
                 why we got along so well.

            <p>
                Matcha isn’t something I had in my house growing up, but it is something that I 
                came to love when I grew older. The subtle earthy flavor is both reflected and
                 contrasted  by its vibrant green color. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 My friend and I used to drive 40 minutes
                 to get a matcha-flavored smoothie from our favorite boba shop. 
                 These cookies remind me of trying new things and adventure.

            <p>
                Yes, they’re not technically a cookie. 
                They are baked on shortbread, which is a cookie. 
                A few years ago, we moved to a house with a lemon tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would usually give lemons to our neighbours and 
                friends. But when quarantine started last year, we 
                suddenly had a tree filled with lemons and no one 
                to give them to! Lemon themed recipes have become the norm.
